Project Title: Voice Controlled Home Automation System using Arduino and Bluetooth
🛠 Overview
This project presents a low-cost, voice-controlled home automation system that allows users to control household electrical appliances using simple voice commands via a smartphone. The system is built using an Arduino Uno, Bluetooth module (HC-05), and Relay module to switch devices like lights and fans ON or OFF.

🎯 Objective
To design a smart automation system that enhances convenience, particularly for elderly and physically challenged individuals, by enabling wireless control of appliances using voice input.

🔧 Hardware Components
Arduino Uno

HC-05 Bluetooth Module

Relay Module (4-channel)

Android Smartphone with voice recognition app

230V AC appliances (e.g., bulb, fan)

💡 Key Features
🎙 Voice-activated control

📱 Wireless operation via smartphone

⚡ Relay switching for high-voltage appliances

💰 Cost-effective and beginner-friendly

⚙️ Working Principle
The user speaks a command into the Android app, which processes the speech and sends a corresponding string via Bluetooth to the Arduino. The Arduino reads the command and activates or deactivates the appropriate relay to control the connected appliance.

🔐 Safety Note
High-voltage handling (230V AC) should be done with caution and proper insulation to avoid electrical hazards.

📚 Technologies Used
Embedded C (Arduino IDE)

Serial communication via Bluetooth

Android-based voice recognition

🚀 Future Enhancements
Integrate Wi-Fi (e.g., NodeMCU) for remote access

Add feedback mechanism for status monitoring

Include temperature or motion sensors for automation triggers
